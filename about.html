        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
            - Exodus 34:6
        </p>

        <p>I am a Christian, I believe Jesus Christ is the living Son of God as described in the Bible. Dying for the sins of those who believe and trust in Him, including me, and risen on the 3rd day.
            I enjoy being around my family and friends. I think, as humans, we are designed to be around others and there can be great joy in that company. Also, since middle school, I have been playing
            volleyball; a sport I still play at 28 years old. Tennis is pretty cool too. Lastly, New York pizza is really good!
        </p>
