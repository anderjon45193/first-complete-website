            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>While taking the <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open">App Academy Open</a> bootcamp coursework, one of the first, slightly major, projects involves making a website using HTML and CSS. Using what I have learned in the course and, I suppose, if possible, elsewhere. In my efforts of creating this website, I will try to effectively implement a structure with HTML tags that make logical sense in labeling content, as well as,
                provide an aesthetically-appeasing design. I believe, from my experience, that some of the most effective websites, in terms of useability and having a sense of encouragement for sustained duration of user interaction, involves the implementation
                of a seemingly simple layout. Implementing a 'page flow', with structural elements that are easily distinguishable and purposeful. The CSS should be used to enhance the browser's default stylings, however, not "over doing it". This type of approach, I believe, contributes to
                decreasing page speeds of the website, to which the faster, the better.
            </p>
            <p>Having a simple website with appropriate stylings producing load speeds that are faster than the market is worth the sacrifice, in terms of enhanced interactivity and/or style.</p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
                In learning HTML, the primary purose is the meaningful structuring of content. If you look above this
                line of text, you can see the title of this section is 'HTML'. However, when defining that specific title element within HTML,
                that title is referred to as a 'Heading'; which vary in levels of importance, from a classifaction of 1-6. The title tag is reserved for the title of
                the website, which can be seen by the text of a tab in your browser. In our case, it should state, my name, 'Jonathan Anderson'.
                Moving on, this section of text here, that you have been reading, is wrapped in a paragraph tag, which is just a
                opening, ('<'), and closing ('>') angle bracket, enclosed with the character, 'p', inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, we are a on a separate paragraph, as sort of implied by the break and apparent whitespace. This is done automatically by the browser, which is pretty nice, since, I would suppose, many websites are composed primarily of paragraphical text. Having to account for each separation in a paragraph in CSS, would just be another step to think about it. But, thankfully, it appears the browser does that for us.
            </p>

            <p>These were just three HTML tags, briefly spoken about, that could account for a simple website provided that the appropriate boilermaker is in place.</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Within CSS, it seems to be convention to have the styles separately located in a .css file, versus styling within the HTML file itself. This concept
                goes along with the purpose of organization; containing 'like things' in the same place. Within CSS, there is something called a 'rule', which is what the
                .css file is built of. A rule consists of a: css selector, declaration block utilizing curly braces, a property and a property value. There are many property-value pairs
                that can be utilized to select different elements within the HTML document applying style, which allows for a large number of styling abilities.
            </p>
            <p>Selectors are one of the foundations of CSS, within HTML you can have classes, tags, and IDs. You can group similar groups
                of content to style the same, or pin-point specific elements using their ID. Overriding styles when necessary.
            </p>

            <h3>Examples of CSS Properties</h3>
            <ul class="properties">
                <li>font-family</li>
                <li>padding</li>
                <li>font-color</li>
                <li>margin</li>
                <li>border</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Examples of CSS Values</h3>
            <ul class="values">
                <li>'Times New Roman'</li>
                <li>25px</li>
                <li>grey</li>
                <li>75%</li>
                <li>solid</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Important Resources</h2>
            <p>When learning HTML & CSS, it can be beneficial to have a resource or set of resources to be able to reference
                when you encounter an issue when developing your own website or another person's website. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a> includes a wide
                array of information specific to HTML, CSS and others. To be able to use this resource effectively, I believe it is important to be able to
                acutely know the specific issue you have. Being able to summarize your problem in a concise string of words can yield better results
                versus falling down rabbit holes with poorly-formatted search queries, answering questions to which do not pertain to your original question.
            </p>
            <p>Tied to having a specific resource handy, is this idea of being able to google well. Having the skill to, as described before, summarize
                your issue in a concise manner will have a better impact on your search results, in my opinion. A common website, you might come across
                while researching your problem, is: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, this idea of someone on the internet having, probably, asked your
                question or a similar question in the past, allows an archived history of questions pertaining to web development, software engineering and the like! Which makes
                the role of someone who works in a technology, to have a good shot at finding the solution to the pertinent problem, without, presently, having to consult with another person; potentially saving time/resources.
